# Geo Meta Data - Google Maps

The concept is to highlight what we can do with Geo Tagged data and how regular people can examine complex data in a visual format.  The idea started with wanting to see history surface temperatures displayed on a map and make this time series data come alive.

What I found is even more interesting airport location data, crime data, traffic accident data, deaths from disease etc. I have experimented with Heatmaps and regular markers such as circles, squares and polygons; Different colors and transparent settings. 

The Data sources are key as of course is key to any good set of information.  Good examples are open data sites that include GEO Data or has some sort of convertible data set.
